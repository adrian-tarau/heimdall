A service is software that performs automated tasks, 
responds to hardware events, or listens for data 
requests from other software. 

The service is identified by its port number and has a 
type. A path is required to access the service if it 
is an HTTP/HTTPS service. 

In the case of HTTP(s) services, the following paths can be registered:

- `Base`: The path to the root of the service.
- `Liveness`: The path to check if the service is alive.
- `Readiness`: The path to check if the service is ready to accept requests.
- `Metrics`: The path to extract metrics from the service.

Furthermore, a service can have 3 types of authentication:

- `Basic`: A simple username and password authentication.
- `Bearer`: An HTTP authentication type that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request.
- `Api Key`: Uses long-lived access tokens embedded directly into an application to authenticate requests to location services.

Services can be registered as _discoverable_ and Heimdall will validate if a server runs the service, and it will automatically register health checks.
