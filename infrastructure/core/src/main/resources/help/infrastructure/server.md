A server is a machine that provides information to other 
machines called clients on computer network. 
This architecture is called the client–server model. 
Servers can provide various functionalities, often called 
[services](admin/infrastructure/service.md).

A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single 
client can use multiple servers. A client process may run 
on the same device or may connect over a network to a server
on a different device. Typical servers are database servers,
file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, 
game servers, and application servers.

Client–server systems are usually most frequently implemented
by (and often identified with) the request–response model: 
a client sends a request to the server, which performs some
action and sends a response back to the client, typically 
with a result or acknowledgment. Designating a computer as
"server-class hardware" implies that it is specialized for 
running servers on it. This often implies that it is more 
powerful and reliable than standard personal computers, but
alternatively, large computing clusters may be composed of 
many relatively simple, replaceable server components.

The Servers dashboard offers granular insights into individual servers that comprise your infrastructure. Each server listed includes information such as:

- Hostname or IP Address
- Server Type (Virtual Machine, Physical, Container)
- Operational Status and Uptime
- Hardware or Virtual Specifications (CPU cores, RAM, Disk space)
- OS Information and Version
 - Performance Metrics (CPU utilization, Memory usage, Disk IO, Network throughput)
 - Related Services Running

Use this view to track server-level performance, resource utilization, and quickly identify problematic or under-performing nodes.
