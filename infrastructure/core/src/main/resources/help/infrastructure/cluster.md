Clusters are groups of [servers](admin/infrastructure/server) that are managed together 
and participate in workload management. The Clusters dashboard displays all clusters managed by your application, providing an aggregated view of their status and usage. Each cluster provides details including:

- Cluster Name and ID

- Operational Status (Healthy, Degraded, Down)

- Number of Nodes and Resources Allocated

-  Resource Usage Metrics (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network)

- Cluster Type (Kubernetes, Database clusters, etc.)

- Recent Alerts or Notifications

This area helps you quickly identify cluster performance, stability, and potential capacity issues.
