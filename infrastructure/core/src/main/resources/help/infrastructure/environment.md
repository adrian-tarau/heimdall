The **Environments** dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the logical environments used within your infrastructure. Environments typically represent distinct operational stages or application lifecycle phases, such as Development, Testing, QA, Staging, and Production.

Within this dashboard, users can quickly identify the state, availability, and overall health of each environment. This high-level view enables quick assessment of environment readiness, resource utilization, and potential bottlenecks. Each environment entry provides the following key information:

* **Name and Description:** Clearly identifies the environmentâ€™s purpose (e.g., "Staging Environment" or "QA Integration Testing") along with a brief description for context.
* **Status:** Real-time indication of the overall health status of the environment, highlighting issues such as outages, degraded performance, or maintenance mode.
* **Clusters and Servers:** A summary count of associated server clusters and individual servers hosting applications and services within that environment.
* **Services Running:** A quick indicator of the total number of active services in each environment.

This dashboard helps users rapidly verify environment readiness before testing sessions, identify resource allocation problems early, and maintain high standards of infrastructure organization and management.
