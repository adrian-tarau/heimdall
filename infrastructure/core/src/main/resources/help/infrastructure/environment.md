A environment is the underlying infrastructure that
supports the application environment. It includes the physical or virtual hardware, networking, storage, services and other resources that are required to host and run the application.

Under Environments, youâ€™ll find an overview of all operational environments managed by Heimdall, such as Development, Staging, and Production. Each environment shows:

- Environment Name (e.g., Development, Production)

- Status Indicators (e.g., Healthy, Warning, Critical)

- Resource Usage Summary (CPU, Memory, Storage utilization)

- Recent Events or Alerts

- Related Clusters and Services

Use this dashboard to quickly understand the health and resource consumption of your various deployment environments.
