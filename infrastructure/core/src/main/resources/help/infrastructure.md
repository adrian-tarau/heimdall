The **Infrastructure** section in Heimdall provides detailed visibility into the underlying components necessary to support the monitored and mocked services. It allows software and QA engineers, as well as administrators, to clearly visualize and understand how various parts of their testing and monitoring infrastructure are organized and interconnected.

Through these dashboards, users can quickly verify the state, health, and relationships among environments, server clusters, individual servers, and running services. Each subsection is carefully organized to offer meaningful insights that help users diagnose issues faster, plan infrastructure adjustments, or verify configuration consistency.

The Infrastructure section is structured into four key areas:

* **Environments** – an overview of logical environments (e.g., development, QA, staging, production) where applications services run.
* **Clusters** – visibility into server groupings that host various applications and services.
* **Servers** – detailed information about individual physical or virtual servers, including their current health and usage metrics.
* **Services** – insights into specific services deployed within the monitored infrastructure.
