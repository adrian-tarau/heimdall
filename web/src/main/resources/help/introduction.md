_Heimdall_ is a monitoring/testing tool for developers, used to validate or troubleshoot services. The tool provides fake services which are used by applications to mimic a real interaction with a remote service.

While it provides some fake services, it does not provide a fake environment. It monitors real environments used to run applications, which will use some of the mocked services.
