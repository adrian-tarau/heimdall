For testing the performance of services, Heimdall integrates the following load-testing tools:

- Apache JMeter
- Grafana K6
- Gatling

Heimdall utilizes these tools' reporting capabilities for individual simulations, but it also integrates the results from these simulations to provide trends and reporting capabilities that surpass their individual functionalities.
