_Heimdall_ provides real-time visibility into the flow of messages between applications and services. In many distributed systems, a message broker acts as the intermediary responsible for routing, queuing, and delivering data between producers (which send messages) and consumers (which receive them).
Heimdallâ€™s allows you to monitor these interactions in detail, helping you validate message delivery, troubleshoot issues, and analyze service behavior under different conditions.

While _Heimdall_ is often used to mimic external services, the dashboards around brokers focuses on monitoring **real message flows** happening in your environment. This includes tracking message events, sessions, and the activity of both producers and consumers. You can use it to confirm that applications are publishing  and consuming messages as expected, and to investigate irregularities such as delivery delays, missing  acknowledgments, or unusual traffic spikes.
