_Heimdall_ provides deep visibility into the state and behavior of the databases used by applications under test. While Heimdall focuses primarily on mocking external services and monitoring service health, it also tracks the performance and resource utilization of the *real* databases connected to those services in order to provide a comprehensive view of application performance.

The dashboards around database metrics helps QA and software engineers observe how applications interact with their backend data stores under various test conditions. Itâ€™s particularly useful for detecting database-related performance bottlenecks, inefficient queries, or transaction anomalies that could impact application behavior in production.
