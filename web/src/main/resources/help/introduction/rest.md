_Heimdall_ can provide visibility into REST-based service through integrated load-testing tools such as **Apache JMeter** and **Grafana K6**. It serves as the primary interface for monitoring, reviewing, and organizing test activities targeting REST APIs in real or simulated environments.

By combining the test execution capabilities of _Apache JMeter_ and _Grafana K6_ with Heimdallâ€™s monitoring and reporting features, users can quickly identify issues, analyze trends, and fine-tune test configurations.

The reporting capabilities of these tools are used to display individual simulations, but it also integrates the results from these simulations to provide dashboards, trends and reporting capabilities that surpass their individual functionalities.
