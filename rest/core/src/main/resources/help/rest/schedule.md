The **Schedule** dashboard displays all schedules that have been registered for simulations. A schedule defines when a particular simulation will be executed automatically, typically as part of ongoing performance or regression testing.

This dashboard allows you to:

* **View registered schedules** – See which scenarios are linked to schedules, along with their configured execution frequency (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).
* **Check next run times** – Review when each scheduled test is set to run next.
* **Review last run status** – See whether the most recent scheduled execution passed or failed, along with key performance indicators from that run.
* **Filter by simulation, scenario, or schedule name** – Narrow down the list to quickly find relevant schedules.
* **Manually trigger a schedule** – Start a scheduled execution immediately without waiting for the next planned time, useful for urgent verification or troubleshooting.

This subsection is especially useful for keeping track of which scenarios are tested regularly, ensuring coverage, and triggering additional runs when needed.
