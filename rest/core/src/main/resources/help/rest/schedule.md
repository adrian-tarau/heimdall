The **Schedule** subsection allows you to automate the execution of REST-based tests by defining when and
how often a scenario should run. This is particularly useful for continuous performance monitoring,
regression detection, and validating service stability over time without requiring manual intervention.

A schedule typically includes:

* **Linked Scenario** – The predefined scenario that will be executed according to the schedule.
* **Execution Frequency** – Options such as hourly, daily, weekly, or custom intervals.
* **Start Time & End Time** – The time range during which the schedule is active.

From the Schedule dashboard, you can:

* **Create New Schedules** by linking them to existing scenarios.
* **Edit or Pause Schedules** when adjustments or temporary suspensions are needed.
* **View Upcoming Runs** in a calendar or list format.
* **Check Past Scheduled Runs** directly from the schedule view for quick verification.

Using scheduled executions helps teams **maintain long-term visibility into performance trends** and
**catch issues early**, especially in environments where service usage or infrastructure changes occur regularly.
 When combined with History, it becomes easy to correlate system changes with test result variations.
