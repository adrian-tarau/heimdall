The **History** subsection provides a chronological record of all REST-based test executions performed through Heimdall using **JMeter** or **K6**. It allows users to review and analyze the results of previous tests, making it easier to identify patterns, track improvements, or detect performance regressions over time.

Each entry in the History view typically contains:

* **Test Name** – The name of the executed scenario or simulation.
* **Execution Date & Time** – When the test started and finished.
* **Tool Used** – Indicates whether the test was executed using JMeter or K6.

The History dashboard often includes **filtering and search options** to help you narrow down results by date
range, tool type, test name, or result status. Selecting a specific test entry will display
**detailed execution metrics** such as response code distribution, failure messages, and request-by-request performance data.

This section is especially useful for:

* **Root Cause Analysis** – Reviewing past test failures to identify the source of performance or functional issues.
* **Regression Tracking** – Comparing recent runs to historical benchmarks.
* **Audit & Reporting** – Providing stakeholders with evidence of system performance over time.
