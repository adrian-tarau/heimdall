The **REST API** section provides visibility into REST-based service testing performed through integrated load-testing tools such as **Apache JMeter** and **Grafana K6**. It serves as the primary interface for monitoring, reviewing, and organizing test activities targeting REST services in real or simulated environments.

This section is designed for **software engineers, QA engineers, and technical administrators** who need to validate service performance, verify functional correctness, and troubleshoot failures. By combining the test execution capabilities of JMeter and K6 with Heimdall’s monitoring and reporting features, the Rest dashboard allows users to quickly identify issues, analyze trends, and fine-tune test configurations.

The _REST API_ dashboard is organized into four key areas:

* **Simulations** – View aggregated performance metrics for all runs of a registered simulation (a complete load test script).
* **Scenario** – Drill down into aggregated performance metrics for a specific scenario within a simulation.
* **Schedule** – View recurring or time-based test executions.
* **Running** – Monitor active test runs in real time, including live metrics and control options.
* **History** – Review past test executions, including performance metrics, request/response details, and error rates.

Together, dashboards provide a complete view into _REST (API)_ validation — from designing scenarios to running them on a schedule, analyzing the results, and running targeted simulations to reproduce issues or confirm fixes.
