The **Rest** dashboard provides visibility into REST-based service testing performed through integrated load-testing tools such as **Apache JMeter** and **K6**. It serves as the primary interface for monitoring, reviewing, and organizing test activities targeting REST APIs in real or simulated environments. While Heimdall is capable of providing mocked services, the Rest dashboard focuses on interactions with actual environments, ensuring that test results reflect realistic system behavior under controlled workloads.

This dashboard is designed for **software engineers, QA engineers, and technical administrators** who need to validate service performance, verify functional correctness, and troubleshoot failures. By combining the test execution capabilities of JMeter and K6 with Heimdall’s monitoring and reporting features, the Rest dashboard allows users to quickly identify issues, analyze trends, and fine-tune test configurations.

The Rest dashboard is organized into four sub-sections:

* **History** – Review past test executions, including performance metrics, request/response details, and error rates.
* **Scenario** – Define, store, and manage reusable test scenarios, including parameters, payloads, and assertions.
* **Schedule** – Set up recurring or time-based test executions to automate performance validation.
* **Simulation** – Launch on-demand tests to simulate traffic patterns or stress-test a service.

Together, these sub-sections provide a complete workflow for REST API validation — from designing scenarios to running them on a schedule, analyzing the results, and running targeted simulations to reproduce issues or confirm fixes.
