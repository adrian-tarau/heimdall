The [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) is a technical standard for transmitting electronic mail (email) over a network.

Applications will connect to an SMTP gateway/relay and pass the message to be sent out to one or more email addresses. _Heimdall_ acts like such a relay, receives the email but instead of forwarding the email to an inbox, it stores the email for later retrieval and exploration.
