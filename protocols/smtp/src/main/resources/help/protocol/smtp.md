The [Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol) is a technical standard for transmitting electronic mail (email) over a network.

Applications will connect to an SMTP gateway/relay and pass the message to be sent out to one or more email addresses. _Heimdall_ acts like such a relay, receives the email but instead of forwarding the email to an inbox, it stores the email for later retrieval and exploration.

Each email received by _Heimdall_ will be displayed in the dashboard (by default sorted by received time in descending order) and the whole email can be visualized by clicking on the _Subject_ column: 

The dialog shows the _Subject_, _From_ & _To_ fields, _Sent_ & _Received_ timestamp and the attachments. The attachments are clickable and allows to download the attachment.
