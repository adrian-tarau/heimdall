The **Producer** view displays information about the components or services that send messages to the broker.
In a distributed architecture, producers are responsible for publishing data that will be routed to one or
more consumers. Monitoring producer behavior is essential for ensuring that messages are being generated at
the expected rate, with the correct content, and without delivery failures.

In Heimdall, the Producer dashboard includes:

* **Producer List** – Shows all active and recently active producers, along with identifiers such as producer name
 and target topic/queue.
* **Status Indicators** – Highlights whether each producer is connected, idle, or disconnected.
* **Message Throughput** – Tracks the rate of published messages over time, allowing detection of underproduction,
 bursts, or stalls.
* **Error** – Displays failed publish attempts, broker rejections, or protocol errors.

**Typical use cases:**

* **Integration verification** – Ensure that test producers in Heimdall are sending messages in the correct format
 and sequence to the broker.
* **Performance testing** – Monitor how quickly and consistently producers can generate load for consumers.
* **Failure analysis** – Identify if publishing stops unexpectedly due to application crashes, misconfigurations,
 or broker-side issues.

By tracking producer activity, engineers can verify that the message pipeline is being fed correctly and detect problems before they propagate downstream to consumers.
