A message broker is a software system that allows applications, systems, and services to communicate and exchange
information. It translates messages between different messaging protocols, enabling interdependent services to
interact directly, even if they are written in different programming languages or operate on various platforms.
Message brokers can validate, store, route, and deliver messages to the appropriate destinations.
They serve as intermediaries between applications, allowing senders to send messages without needing to know the
recipients' locations, whether they are active, or how many exist.
This functionality helps decouple processes and services within systems.
